This will be incomplete - 
This challenge is too much for me, I am struggling HARDCORE with this process and, honestly, struggling believing I will succeed in this field. 
I now regret not taking time to see if Cyber Security would be up my alley, since I wasn't doing well with C# in Foundation
I'm not sure what to do, but leave this info here
Hopefully; I will come back to this in the future and witness amazing growth throughout the remaining 9wks
